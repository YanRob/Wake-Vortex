# Wake-Vortex

This code is still in development.

Several programs around aircraft wake vortex analysis and simulation.

They are based on my professional experience of several years spent with the analysis and simulation of aircraft wake vortices.
During that time, I programmed several tools and software to these purposes. 
The original ones are, for obvious reasons, not available. 
The programs here have been only written to preserve my expertise in this domain and practice Python programming.
They contains no confidential data or algorithms.

**Vortex Profile**
- functions related to the characteristics of a single vortex (radius, max. velocity, circulation)
- vortex reconstruction
- vortex fitting with calcultion of core size and circulation
